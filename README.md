# DebugSystem

This is a simple asset for Unity to help developers to debug some basic informations on screen.<br>

I started developing the <strong>Debug System</strong> for a Unity project I was developing at the time. I don't use Unity only to develop video games, I work at
a company that creates interactive applications, such as VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality), video games, mobile games, apps and more.
Visit us <a href="http://en.indice.in">Indice</a>. <br><br>
And this asset helped me to better debug some fast informations about the app and the target device. I'll continue to improve the 
asset, but that is not my priority right now.

# Quick Start

1 - Download the project package.<br>
2 - Extract inside Unity v5.0 or higher.<br>
3 - Drag the <strong>DebugSystem</strong> prefab to the scene. (path: <i>Assets/DebugSystem/Prefab</i>)
